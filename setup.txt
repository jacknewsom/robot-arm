Setup for robot-arm

This document assumes little to no prior programming experience. 


For MacOS: 

--- Text Editor ---
You may want to install a text editor. I recommend using https://www.sublimetext.com/3

Using the terminal, you can create a shortcut to access sublime with a terminal command, by creating a symbolic link.
	mkdir /usr/local/bin
	ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl

*If the first command returns an error, it means your user account doesn't have permission to create this subdirectory. This can be fixed by typing the following. 
	sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin

This allows you to open Sublime from terminal using the command:
	subl filename.py


--- Installing Python 3 ---
Instructions pulled from: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/

Install Homebrew (this is a package manager for macOS)
	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Add "brew" command to path
	subl ~/.profile
	export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH

Now you can install Python3
	brew install python


--- Using Github ---
Cheat Sheet: https://gist.github.com/davfre/8313299

I recommend creating a folder in your computer called "code" and storing projects within it. 
	mkdir code/engineeringclub/

Then to clone robot-arm repo from github
	git clone https://github.com/nooseman/robot-arm.git

This copies the contents of the github repository to your desktop and allows you to mess around with the files.
