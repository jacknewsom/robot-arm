For MacOS: 

---- Text Editor -----
You may want to install a text editor. I recommend using https://www.sublimetext.com/3

Using the terminal, you can create a shortcut to access subl with a terminal command, by creating a symbolic link.
	mkdir /usr/local/bin
	ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl
This allows you to open Sublime from terminal using the command:
	subl filename.py
